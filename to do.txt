1. Install Three.js which will allow webGL rendering
--run: npm install three --force and npm audit fix --force
--check package.json -- three is listed, also check node modules -- three is there

2. Replace the Canvas 2D Context with Three.js Scene
--initiate the renderer, scene, camera, and loader

3. Load and Replace All Game Objects with .glb Models
--add .glb models to public/assets folder
--update the rendering logic to requestAnimationFrame, then updateObjects, then render the objects
--load all models and store the models using THREE.js loader instead of custom assets.js loader
--use promise-then to load all models, and then do everything else
--create object groups for player, others, asteroids, bullets and clone the model for each
--replace rendering functions for each type of object, with updating functions
